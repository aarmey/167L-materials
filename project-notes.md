## Independent Projects Guidelines

- One project per lab group, but each group member writes their own report
- Bring an idea to your TA by Lab 9
- After discussing your idea with your TA, turn in your final plan by week 7
- Project proposal is only 1 paragraph (3-4 sentences)

### Scope

- Experimental portion should take 2-3 lab periods
- Utilize techniques and concepts that you have learned throughout the quarter
- Try to use materials already available in the lab if possible, we can order a small amount of reagents or borrow things from research labs
- We can do some time-lapse microscopy if you coordinate with us
- Discuss ideas with the TAs and me
- Be creative!

### Potential Ideas

- Investigate cell viability in different pH medium or different solutions
- Test cell migration speed across different distances (wound healing assay)
- Test viability of cells encapsulated at different densities or different concentrations of alginate
- Evaluate extent of cell adhesion to surfaces with varying hydrophobicity
- Test the relationship between cell shape and which cells go on to divide
- Talk to me or your TAs about ideas!

### Final Lab Report

- Due finals week
– Upload as a pdf file to CCLE
- Report your results and findings of your independent labs in form of a short journal paper
– 5 pgs max (including figures + captions, but not references), 11 pt font, Times New Roman or Arial, 0.5 in margins
– Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References
