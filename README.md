## 2. Course Description

This class will focus on the development of practical laboratory skills and analytical techniques of use for bioengineering research. At the end of this lab, you will be familiar with experimental methods to interrogate mammalian cell behavior. This will involve step-by-step laboratories investigating various aspects of bioengineering including bioconjugation, soft lithography, surface modification, microcontact printing, cell and tissue culture, and microscopy. Lectures will be synchronized with your laboratory investigations to provide a broader context to the experimental techniques and provide valuable opportunities for analysis of current scientific writing and research practices.

**Learning Outcomes:** By the end of the quarter you will be able to do the following:

1. **Critical Laboratory Skills**: Gain a diverse skill set of bioengineering skills useful for current biomedical engineering research and practice.
2. **Critical Thinking and Analysis**: Understand the process of scientific experimentation, analysis of current research, and developing
logically sound experimental processes.
3. **Scientific/Engineering Documentation**: Document experimental progress in a laboratory notebook, understand the preparation of scientific papers.
4. **Manage and Work in Teams**: Learn to work and communicate effectively with peers to attain a common goal.

### 4.1. Participation Grade (23%)

Participation is graded out of a total of 46 points based on the following.

- Lab Attendance and Performance
    - Lab notebooks (12 points)
    - Working productively and respectfully with my lab partner (6 points)
    - Pre-lab preparation and quizzes (12 points)
- Readings and In-Class Discussions
    - Summary paragraphs/questions from reading (9 points)
    - Participation in class discussions (3 points)
- Independent Project Planning
    - Turn in your 1^st^ independent lab proposal and discuss with your TA (2 points)
    - Turn in your final independent lab proposal on time (2 points)

#### 4.1.1. Laboratory Attendance and Performance:

##### Pre-lab preparation and quizzes (12 points)

Students are expected to be on time to and attend every lab session. *One-question quizzes will be given at the beginning of each lab section on the prelab assignment.* Quiz questions will be based on information provided in lab session protocols, supplemental reading and video content posted on the class website. Each lab session (Labs 1-12) will be work 1 pt towards your final participation grade. **You must bring lab protocols with you to the lab and be prepared to work independently.**

**Working productively and respectfully with my lab partner (6 points):** Your TA will assign you to a lab partner with whom you will work on Labs 1–12 and your independent project. This part of the class is a lesson in learning how to work productively with other people. Please be respectful to your lab partner by engaging fully and making contributions to your team.

**Lab notebooks (12 points)**: The purpose of your lab notebook is to record your experiments ***while you are doing them***. You should have an entry for each lab session including your methods and raw data. You can print out and paste in protocols from online; however, you must make notes on any changes in your notebook during your lab session. Your raw data must also be recorded when you get the data during your lab session. Your TA will check your notebook to make sure you have recorded everything during each lab session. Each lab session (Labs 1–12) will be work 1 pt towards your final participation grade.

**Additional information about lab attendance:** You expected to attend and participate in every lab session. If you have conflicts with a lab session, you must notify your TA, lab partner(s), and Dr. Meyer in advance and arrange a time to make-up the lab. Ideally, this will be in another lab session when the lab you need to miss is already being performed. For example, if you will be out on a Monday, try to make-up in the Tuesday session the very next day. If you will be attending another lab session, you must notify the TA for that lab session in addition to your normal TA. *Please notify us at least 48 hrs in advance so we can ensure lab materials are available.* If you cannot attend another lab session due to an illness or family emergency, there will be an opportunity for make-ups during week 9. If you plan to make up a lab on this date, please discuss arrangements with the head TA and Dr. Meyer. If you do end up needing to make-up a lab session, we will re-grade your revised lab report (including the missed section) after the make-up lab.

#### 4.1.2. Pre-Class Readings:

We will review several experiments and papers in the recent literature that relate to the laboratory techniques we will use. During the lecture, we will critically analyze and discuss the results and experimental methods used in these papers. To prepare for the discussion you will be required to read the papers before class and address questions specific to each reading. While you may discuss these papers with others, your answers should be written individually. Any duplicate text or other plagiarism will result in a zero for the assignment. PDFs of the papers will be posted on CCLE.

**Grading for Case Study Summary Paragraphs:**

3
~ student has accurately addressed the questions and provided insightful, critical interpretations of the results and presentation

2
~ student satisfactorily understands the manuscript content and provides at least some critical analysis/interpretation

1
~ student does not appear to understand the content of the manuscript and provides no insight into the study

0
~ student did not turn in a summary

#### 4.1.3. Independent Project Proposals:

Labs 13, 14 and 15 will be dedicated to your independent project. More details will be provided in lecture. Briefly, you and your lab partner will propose a hypothesis, design an experiment to test this hypothesis, and perform your experiments during lab sessions. Your final lab reports will be based on these experiments. You will turn in a draft of your proposals, discuss with your TA and make adjustments as necessary, and then turn in a final draft of your proposal. Proposal drafts will be worth 2 participation points each.

### 4.2. Lab Reports (27%):

There will be *three lab reports* due throughout the quarter. These will use data collected from the labs and answer critical thinking questions about your data. Specific information about the lab report requirements is posted on the class website.

### 4.3. Final Laboratory Report (15%):

For the final lab report, you will present an analysis of your independent lab experiments in the format of a short journal paper. More details on the exact requirements are on the class website and in week 5 lecture.

Although data from your group will be identical, laboratory reports must be worked on and turned in independently. Duplication of text or figures between laboratory reports will result in a zero on the assignment for both parties. Duplication of text or figures from reports from previous years also will result in a zero on the assignment. Slight or moderate variations in word choice, the addition of words, word order, or sentence order are also considered duplication. It is easier to start from scratch than to work off of another report.

Your final report *will be due during finals week.* This will be 15% of your final grade.

### 4.4. Exams (35%):

The course will have 3 exams. These include two exams during the lecture time and a "practical" exam during week 8 in your lab sessions.

#### 4.4.1. Lab Practical Exam:

The lab practical will be an exam of your laboratory skills learned up to week 8 and will be conducted by your TA. This will involve a written and exercise-based exam concerning laboratory practice conducted during the laboratory period. This is worth 10% of your final grade.

#### 4.4.2. Lecture Exams:

Two exams will be given in lecture on topics covered in lecture. Each of these will be 12.5% of your final grade. Both exams will generally not be cumulative, covering lecture and reading material from the previous weeks. Example prior exams are posted on the class website.
